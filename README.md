# The PyPhone
Voice and SMS/MMS on a Raspberry Pi 3B+

Simple communication with minimal dependencies.  All you need is a Raspberry 3B+ with touchscreen, a Logitech USB Headset H390 and an ethernet cable.

No Apple ID, No Google Account, No SIM, nothing else required.

The code is Python 3 (with a bunch of packages from PyPy) and GTK.
