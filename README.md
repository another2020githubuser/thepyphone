# The PyPhone
Voice and SMS/MMS on a Raspberry Pi 3B+

Simple communication with minimal dependencies.  All you need is a Raspberry 3B+ with touchscreen, a Logitech USB H390 Headset an ethernet cable and a PyPhone account.

My vision is to re-think and de-centralize communication, from both a hardware and software perspective.

Built backwards, I built this for myself first, so no barely working MVP here.  This is  stable code that I use as my daily driver.
