# The PyPhone
Voice and SMS/MMS on a Raspberry Pi 3B+

Simple communication with minimal dependencies.  **All you need is a Raspberry 3B+ with touchscreen, a Logitech USB Headset H390 and an ethernet cable.**  No Apple ID, No Google Account, No SIM, nothing else required.

I view this project as a start towards a more open communications infrastructure. This is open source software, running on fairly open source hardware.

The home phone is not dead, it just needs to be extended to the 21st century.  

Works fine over Wi-Fi.  Tested in multiple contintents including North and South America and Europe.  Works fine. The phone appeared to be a US phone.

Not encrypted.  Everything you say or type will end up transmitted plain text over the public Internet.  Don't use this for illegal stuff.

The code is Python 3 (with a bunch of packages from PyPy) and GTK.  Built backwards, I built this for myself first, so no barely working MVP here.  This is  stable code that I use as my daily driver.
